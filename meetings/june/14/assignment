 - Understand 2-solitons
 - Check explicit 2-soliton (6.19) and compute energy
	- show soliton resolution in L2 for this case
 - Understand action of Galilei, scaling on H_kappa
 - Compute energy of travelling solitary waves R_vw (these really should be called the solitons)
 - Are R_vw minimizers of E s.t. P = const (P = <Dq, q> - 1/2 ||q||_4^4)
 - Do numerics! (use split-step method for handling the nonlinearities)
 - look at u(x+i) and see how it evolves
