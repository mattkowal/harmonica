N-Soliton for CMDNLS
    from : The Calogero-Moser Derivative Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation - Gerard and Lenzmann (pg 21+)
    description : Given the pole ansatz with N poles in the lower half plane, we get an N soliton with solution
            u(t,x) = Sum a_j(t)/(x - z_j(t))
        where the poles z_j follow a complexified Caloger-Moser.

        half-waves map equation (arXiv:2006.16826 - Berntson, Klabbers, Langmnann)

Intermediate Non-Linear Schrodinger
    solitons : none (A spectral transform for the intermediate nonlinear Schrodinger equation - Pelinovsky)
    dark solitons : yes (Nonlocal Models for Envelope Waves in a Stratified Fluid - Pelinovsky)
